# Beets player using HTML5 audio and W2UI
This is an example of using W2UI and HTML5 audio to play music from a beets server running the beetsweb plugin.

To use this edit the BEETSWEB variable inside the html file and point it to your beetsweb installation, then just open it in browser.

This requires CORS support in the beets web plugin, currently pending a pull request in the beets github source.
